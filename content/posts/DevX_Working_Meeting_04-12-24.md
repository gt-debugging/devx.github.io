The Debugging Workgroup of the GDR GPL will soon evolve towards the topic of the Developer Experience (DevX), whether the developer is a software engineer, a scientist, a business expert, etc..  In this context, we are organizing a one-day workshop to identify the French community on this topic and to define the scientific scope of this future new WG.
